        heading: "How much wood do I need for a winter?",
        body: "It depends on the appliance and how you use it. For a log stove used as supplementary heating in the evening and at weekends, allow 5 to 8 loose cubic metres per season. As primary heating in a reasonably insulated house, allow 12 to 18.\n\nTo picture those volumes: one loose cubic metre is roughly 0.7 stacked cubic metres once stacked, and weighs around 420 kg in hardwood below 18 % moisture. If you are unsure about the quantity, call us rather than guess.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Which log length should I choose?",
        body: "Measure the width of the firebox and take five centimetres off each side. 25 cm suits compact stoves, 33 cm is the most common length, 50 cm is for wide inserts and open fireplaces.\n\nIf in doubt, take the shorter length: a log that is too long will not fit, whereas a shorter one burns perfectly well.",
      },
      {
        heading: "What is the difference between loose, stacked and solid cubic metres?",
        body: "A loose cubic metre is a cubic metre of wood tipped in loose. Neatly stacked, the same volume gives roughly 0.7 stacked cubic metres. Remove all the air between the logs and about 0.4 solid cubic metres of actual wood remains.\n\nWe sell by the loose cubic metre, because that is the quantity that actually arrives at your place.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Is the wood really dry?",
        body: "Our wood leaves the kiln after 72 hours at 75 °C, with a moisture content below 18 %. Every batch is measured and the record comes with the delivery.\n\nTo check for yourself, push a moisture meter into a freshly split log rather than the outer face: on the outside, even wet wood gives a low reading.",
      },
      {
        heading: "How should I store the wood after delivery?",
        body: "Under cover, away from the wall so air can circulate, and never directly on the ground — a pallet underneath is enough. Kiln-dried wood no longer needs to dry, but it takes moisture back up if it is exposed.\n\nIn a closed, unventilated cellar, wood is back above 20 % within a year.",
